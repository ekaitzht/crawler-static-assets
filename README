My algorithm works recursively, it starts from the root link and
the we crawl the links with src attributes and href attributes.
We will call recursively again to those links that are not out of the domain
and links that are not static.

My main challenge is discovering  how I can know when href or src is
a static asset I have hardcoded the typical static assets extensions like
png, jpg, js, css, etc. However I know this not the best approach because is
not a general solution if we detect new extensions my algorithm is not going
to detect these static assets.

As well I have had difficulties to differenciate internal links to externals 
links for example vimeo videos //player.vimeo.com/video.

My algorithm it was saving static assets in a Hash of Arrays where each
hash is the link crawled and the array is all assets that correspond to
this link at the end of the algorithm I pass this hash myfile.out.
